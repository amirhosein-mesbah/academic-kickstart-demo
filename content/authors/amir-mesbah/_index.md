Welcome! I am a master’s student of Artificial intelligence and a Junior Research Assistant at the Cognitive Systems lab at the school of ECE at the University of Tehran. I completed my BA in Computer Engineering at the University of Tabriz (ECE faculty). My interests in machine learning and computer science began through many fun experiences working with computer in childhood.  

My research focuses on enabling RL agents to use the benefit of social learning during their learning procces like humans and social animals. I’ve been fortunate to have many wonderful supervisors on this topics, including Dr.Nili.
